What is Tuxidow ?
=================

Tuxidow is a filesystem read program, that can read ext2/ext3 filesystems from a WIN32 platform. It helps in detecting and reading ext2 compatible filsystems from a Windows NT compatible(2000/XP) env . Currently it supports filesystem read and importing of files/directories etc. No write operations are performed as of now. 
Tuxidow is tested and developed on a Windows XP platform, and is compatible with NT/2000 systems. Windows 9X versions are unsupported as the method of diskIO varies in these releases.

License
=======
Tuxidow was initially released on 1st March 2005 under a GNU GPLv2 license. Currently it is licensed under GNU GPLv3.

Source code
===========
Use Microsoft Visual Studio .Net edition for building the code.

Development status
==================
There are no further plans for development, however some of the possible areas of enhancement are : 
	* Write support
	* Support for Ext4/Reiserfs/Btrfs. 
	* Support for filesystem images.
	* Support for newer windows releases. 

There may be bugs/incompatibilities with newer versions of ext3. You are always welcome to contribute or take over ! 
And the code should be easily portable to Windows VISTA/7 versions.
